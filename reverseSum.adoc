Let's define the reverse of an integer x as the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits of x and then moving any leading zeroes to the end of the resulting number.

demonstration

Given an array of integers arr, your task is to calculate the sum of reverse numbers of the elements of arr.

Example

For arr = [7, 234, 58100], the output should be sumOfReversed(arr) = 18939.

The reverse of 7 is 7.
The reverse of 234 is 432.
The reverse of 58100 is 18500.
So the answer is 7 + 432 + 18500 = 18939.
For arr = [0, 100, 220], the output should be sumOfReversed(arr) = 320.

The reverse of 0 is 0.
The reverse of 100 is 100.
The reverse of 220 is 220.
So the answer is 0 + 100 + 220 = 320.
