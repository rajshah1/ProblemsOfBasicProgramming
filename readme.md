## 1.) 2 string   
file name: twosstring.py

Given two strings of equal length, you have to tell whether they both strings are identical.

Two strings S1 and S2 are said to be identical, if any of the permutation of string S1 is equal to the string S2. See Sample explanation for more details.

## Input :

First line, contains an intger 'T' denoting no. of test cases.
Each test consists of a single line, containing two space separated strings S1 and S2 of equal length.

## Output:

For each test case, if any of the permutation of string S1 is equal to the string S2 print YES else print NO.

##  3). seating arrengment

file name : settingArr.py


Akash and Vishal are quite fond of travelling. They mostly travel by railways. They were travelling in a train one day and they got interested in the seating arrangement of their compartment. The compartment looked something like

Window Seat : WS
Middle Seat : MS
Aisle Seat : AS

##  INPUT
First line of input will consist of a single integer T denoting number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of a single integer N denoting the seat-number.

## OUTPUT
For each test case, print the facing seat-number and the seat-type, separated by a single space in a new line.

## 4) anagram Delete Problem

Given two strings, a and b , that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make a and b anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.

## Input :

test cases,t
two strings a and b, for each test case

## Output:

Desired O/p
Constraints :
string lengths<=10000

## 5).  Find product

file name : findProduct.py

You have been given an array A of size N consisting of positive integers. You need to find and print the product of all the number in this array Modulo .

## Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array

## Output Format:
Print a single integer denoting the product of all the elements of the array Modulo 10^9+7.

## Input Format
The first and only line of input contains 3 space separated integers l, r and k.

## Output Format
Print the required answer on a single line.

```
1 10 1
output:
10
```
